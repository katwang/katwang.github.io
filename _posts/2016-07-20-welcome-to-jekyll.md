<h2> Predicting mortality using logistic regression </h2>

**Dataset**: [Framingham Heart Study](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/shhs)

This is an in-depth exploration of using logistic regression to predict mortality in the Framingham Heart Study cohort. I looked into model interpretation, adjusting for confounders and effect modifiers, and non-linear methods.
