The Framingham Heart Study is a famous long-term prospective cohort study about cardiovascular disease among people in Framingham, Massachusetts. The data used in this study is a teaching dataset provided by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. This analysis explores the effect of BMI on mortality using logistic regression. I looked into model interpretation, adjusting for confounders and effect modifiers, and non-linear methods.
