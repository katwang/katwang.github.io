HIV is a worldwide pandemic, with an estimated 2.5 million new infections every year. Sexually transmitted HIV is spread through seri-discordant couples, making network models a great way to help us understand the spread of disease. It would also help us design effective prevention measures against the disease. This was an exercise in building a mechanistic model that can model individual-level behaviors in the epidemic spread of HIV/AIDS.
